### 👋 Hi! I'm Yamila De Olivera

I’m a 25-year-old Full Stack Web Developer from Argentina. My passion for technology started with a childhood dream: programming video games. However, life led me down the path of Civil Engineering 🤔. During the pandemic, I had time to reflect and decided to pursue my true passion. In August 2022, I joined HENRY to become a Full Stack Developer and switch my career to Computer Science. Since then, I haven’t looked back! 🚀

Here you'll find a collection of projects and practices that reflect my journey in the programming world. I hope you enjoy exploring them as much as I enjoyed creating them! 😉
