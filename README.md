### Hi there 👋

My name is Yamila De Olivera 👋 and I'm a 24 years old Argentinian Full Stack Web Developer ❤️‍🔥.
Ever since I was a child I wanted to program videogames but at some point in life I ended up doing Civil Engineering🤔. During the pandemic, I had plenty of time available to wonder if that was really what I wanted to do with my life. Turns out it wasn't 😅. On August 2022, I entered HENRY for the full stack developer course. It was at that moment that I knew that was what I wanted to do with my life 😄. After giving my all I graduated from HENRY🤯.
On this Github you will find a collection of practices I completed since I started programming. Hope you enjoy it!😉
 
Here you will find content that gives you veridical proof of my knowledge about the following technologies:
CSS, Javascript, NodeJs, React, Redux, ExpressJs, Sequelize, PostgreSQL.

🌱I'm currently focused on reinforcing my actual knowledge.

😜Facts about me: I love Makeup and I am a professional makeup artist. It is my number one hobby in the world and I wish to make my own app about makeup someday. I am also a little shy when i meet new people but once I am confident enough to speak I'm very easy to get along with. I also love gaming and streaming!
